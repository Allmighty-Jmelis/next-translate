# nextTranslate
An intelligent automatic chat translator LUA for the Stand mod menu.  
  
Next-Translate is a chat translator script that is as simple and intelligent as possible.
It will use Stand's language to automatically select your language, and will automatically translate incoming chat messages into your language accordingly. It even has an intelligent check that will check someone's game language to save some false positives and API calls.

## Install
Download the repo as zip and drag everything from it, except readme.md and license.txt, into your Stand's lua scripts folder. Done.
